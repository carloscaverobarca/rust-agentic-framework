Please analyze the current codebase and generate prompt templates for common development tasks. Create well-structured prompts for:

1. **Development Task Prompts**
   - Feature implementation prompts with TDD guidance
   - Bug fixing prompts with debugging steps
   - Refactoring prompts following "Tidy First" principles
   - Code review prompts with quality checkpoints

2. **Testing Task Prompts**
   - Unit test creation prompts with coverage goals
   - Integration test development prompts
   - Test-driven development workflow prompts
   - Performance and load testing prompts

3. **Documentation Task Prompts**
   - API documentation generation prompts
   - README and setup guide prompts
   - Architecture decision record (ADR) prompts
   - Code comment and inline documentation prompts

4. **Quality Assurance Prompts**
   - Security audit and vulnerability assessment prompts
   - Performance optimization analysis prompts
   - Code quality and maintainability review prompts
   - Dependency and license audit prompts

5. **DevOps and Infrastructure Prompts**
   - CI/CD pipeline setup and optimization prompts
   - Docker and containerization prompts
   - Deployment and scaling prompts
   - Monitoring and observability prompts

Each prompt should include:
- Clear objective and scope
- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected deliverables
- Quality criteria and acceptance standards
- References to relevant best practices

Focus on prompts that would be reusable across different parts of the project and that encourage following TDD and clean code principles.
