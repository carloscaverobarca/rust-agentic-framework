Please analyze the current codebase and generate GitHub issues for improvements and features. Create issues in the following categories:

1. **Bug Reports**
   - Identify potential bugs or edge cases
   - Include steps to reproduce and expected behavior
   - Provide severity and priority labels

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Missing functionality that would improve the system
   - Performance optimizations and scalability improvements
   - User experience and API improvements
   - Integration opportunities with external systems

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Code refactoring opportunities following "Tidy First" principles
   - Architecture improvements and modernization
   - Dependency updates and security patches
   - Documentation gaps and inconsistencies

4. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Missing test coverage areas
   - Integration test scenarios
   - Load and performance testing needs
   - Code quality improvements

5. **Developer Experience**
   - Build and deployment improvements
   - Development tooling enhancements
   - CI/CD pipeline optimizations
   - Documentation and onboarding improvements

Format each issue with:
- Clear, descriptive title
- Detailed description with context
- Acceptance criteria or definition of done
- Appropriate labels (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)
- Estimated complexity/effort level

Focus on actionable items that align with TDD methodology and would provide clear value to the project.
