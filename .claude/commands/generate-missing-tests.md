Please analyze the current codebase and identify missing tests, then generate comprehensive test suites following TDD principles. Focus on:

1. **Unit Test Coverage Analysis**
   - Identify untested functions and methods
   - Analyze code paths and branches without test coverage
   - Find edge cases and error conditions that need testing
   - Review public APIs that lack comprehensive test suites

2. **Test-Driven Development Approach**
   - Generate failing tests first (Red phase)
   - Ensure tests are minimal and focused on single behaviors
   - Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
   - Follow the pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

3. **Integration Test Identification**
   - Identify component interactions that need testing
   - Database integration scenarios
   - External API integration points
   - End-to-end workflow testing needs

4. **Error Path and Edge Case Testing**
   - Invalid input handling tests
   - Network failure and timeout scenarios
   - Resource exhaustion and limit testing
   - Concurrent access and race condition tests

5. **Property-Based and Fuzzing Tests**
   - Identify functions suitable for property-based testing
   - Generate invariant checks and property tests
   - Suggest fuzzing targets for input validation

For each missing test, provide:
- Test file location and structure
- Complete test implementation with setup/teardown
- Mock and fixture requirements
- Expected assertions and error conditions
- Integration with existing test infrastructure

Generate tests that are:
- Fast and deterministic
- Isolated and independent
- Clear and maintainable
- Following Rust testing conventions and best practices

Prioritize tests based on code criticality, complexity, and current coverage gaps.
