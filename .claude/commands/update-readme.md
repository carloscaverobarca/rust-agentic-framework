Please analyze the current codebase structure and update the README.md file to accurately reflect:
1. The actual project structure and crate organization
2. Current dependencies and features
3. Real configuration options and examples
4. Any new tools or capabilities that have been added
5. Correct commands and setup instructions

Keep the existing style and format but ensure all information is current and accurate based on the actual code.
